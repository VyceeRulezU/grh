# Governance Resource Hub V2 - Final Refinement Walkthrough

I have successfully completed the final refinement phase of the Governance Resource Hub V2, transforming it into a premium, feature-rich platform with interactive dashboards and professional design standards.

## Key V2 Features

### 1. Advanced Dashboards (Admin & Student)
- **Admin Shield Portal**: A comprehensive control centre for administrators featuring real-time analytics on user growth and course popularity using **Recharts**.
- **Refined Student Dashboard**: An interactive learner portal with glassmorphism stats, achievement tracking, and a dynamic **Learning Activity** chart.

### 2. Interactive Learning Experience
- **Demo Course Player**: A dedicated learning interface where students can "interact" with the platform, complete with lesson navigation, video viewports, and instructor profiles.
- **Resource Viewer**: Users can now "open" library books and reports in a professional modal viewer with zoom controls and page navigation.

### 3. Data Visualization (Recharts)
- **Analyse Module**: Upgraded with interactive **Area Charts** (WGI Trends) and **Bar Charts** (Sectoral Insights).
- **Assess Module**: Integrated **Radar Charts** for Institutional Readiness Index (IRI) diagnostics.

### 4. Professional Design & Polish

- **Advanced CTA**: Implemented a sophisticated **Eduma-style** Call-to-Action section in the e-learning landing page with statistical highlights.
- **Global Stylization**: Standardized all `h1` headers to **font-weight: 500** and fixed layout issues (footer z-index) for a seamless Apple-style aesthetic.

### 5. Simulations & Security
